# BlenderBabylonExporter
Final Project for Intro to 3D Gaming/Graphics

## Summary
An attempt in expanding Babylon's Blender export to include Blender's game logic bricks and Physics.
As of now this exporter supports Always, Message, Keyboard, and Collision Senors.
As well as the Motion, Parent, Visibility, and Message Actuators.
Controllers are not yet supported, Senors and Actuators can only be connected through a relationship of one Senor to one Controller, with one Controller to one-many Acuators, controller must be an And controller.
The physics currently supports box and sphere colliders.
